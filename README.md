# 2022-Project-1

Site owner's goals: 
Since 2020, the prices of HDB resale flats have been rising rapidly. This served as a motivation to embark on this project; to explore HDB resale trends I was curious about.

User's goals: I want to know more about the history of my region and want an app that shows me how to get to historical places of interest. 

Interactive Features to have: 
● Read historical data of HDB resale transactions from an updated government data source 
● Allow users to filter average HDB resale prices based on a few variables, such as town, flat type and storey range. 
● Display filtered data as a line chart 
● Provides more information in the form of other charts such as heatmap and synchronous charts.
