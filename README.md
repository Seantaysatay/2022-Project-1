Site owner's goals: 
Since 2020, the prices of HDB resale flats have been rising rapidly. This served as my motivation to explore HDB resale trends in recent years.  

User's goals: 
I want to know the historical average price of a HDB resale flat that meets certain conditions, like town, flat type and storey range. 

Interactive Features to have: 
● Read historical data of HDB resale transactions from an updated government data source 
● Allow users to filter average HDB resale prices based on a few variables, such as town, flat type and storey range. 
● Display filtered data as a line chart 
● Provide more information in the form of other charts, such as heatmap and synchronous charts.
